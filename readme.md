# Core Ruby

A 7-week paid online course covering the material in [this tutorial](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html). There are exercises to test and cement our understanding, and we can post our solutions to the private forum. Our instructor, the amazing [Victor Goff](https://github.com/kotp), is extremely generous with his time and provides lots of useful feedback about how to refactor our code or make it more Ruby-esque.

The best $35 I ever spent - I can't believe how much I've learned, and how fun Victor makes it.
